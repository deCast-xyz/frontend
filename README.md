## Overview

DeCast is an open source and extensive live streaming platform for creators. 

As anyone can add whatever modules they want, we can cover 36B hours of view as censorship resistant, non-exploitative, and all-in-one platform.

As the first step, we build modules for token-gate/stream-gate live streaming by subscription with Livepeer, Superfluid, Sismo and Push.

## Problem

While live streaming becomes increasingly important for creators to connect with their audience and around 36B hours of live streaming are watched in 2021, they face several challenges that hinder their growth and creative freedom.

2-1. Censorship and dependency on centralized platforms, limiting control and expression

2-2. Losing a significant portion (30-50%) of their membership revenue to platforms like YouTube and Twitch

2-3. Creators or Developers cannot customize or add features based on their demand.

## Solution

DeCast offers a solution for creators with an open source and extensive live streaming platform tailored for creators.

- Utilizing Livepeer, DeCast provides a decentralized video infrastructure that ensures censorship-resistance and greater autonomy for creators
- Eliminating excessive fees and enabling creators to retain a larger share of their revenue
- With Superfluid money streaming, fans can seamlessly support their favorite creators through easy, secure, and transparent subscriptions
- It‚Äôs open source and module base. So developers / creators can add functionalities as modules.

## How it works
