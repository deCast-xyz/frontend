## Overview

DeCast is an open source and extensive live streaming platform for creators. 

As anyone can add whatever modules they want, we can cover 36B hours of view as censorship resistant, non-exploitative, and all-in-one platform.

As the first step, we build modules for token-gate/stream-gate live streaming by subscription with Livepeer, Superfluid, Sismo and Push.

## Problem

While live streaming becomes increasingly important for creators to connect with their audience and around 36B hours of live streaming are watched in 2021, they face several challenges that hinder their growth and creative freedom.

1. Censorship and dependency on centralized platforms, limiting control and expression

2. Losing a significant portion (30-50%) of their membership revenue to platforms like YouTube and Twitch

3. Creators or Developers cannot customize or add features based on their demand.

## Solution

DeCast offers a solution for creators with an open source and extensive live streaming platform tailored for creators.

- Utilizing Livepeer, DeCast provides a decentralized video infrastructure that ensures censorship-resistance and greater autonomy for creators
- Eliminating excessive fees and enabling creators to retain a larger share of their revenue
- With Superfluid money streaming, fans can seamlessly support their favorite creators through easy, secure, and transparent subscriptions
- It’s open source and module base. So developers / creators can add functionalities as modules.

## How it works

As Creators and Viewers, we will explain the modules of live-streaming and token gate by subscription.

### Creators

1. Create an account by minting Creator NFT and set up membership condition
2. Start live-streaming by selecting modules like stream-gated, NFT-gated with Sismo etc…
3. Do live streaming enabled by OBS app and Livepeer

### Viewers

1. Select creators who are doing live streaming
2. Subscribe membership by paying with Superfluid money streaming
or Prove your holding NFT by Sign in with Sismo
3. Watch live streaming and engage by live chat

### Developers

Developers can add modules on our platform 

## Future work

1. Build the module template for developers to build and add their own modules
2. Add more modules like 1 on 1 video streaming, Tipping etc…

## Polygon💜
We deployed ERC-1155 contract on Polygon Mumbai. So we can distribute it when viewers subscribe creators live streaming.
